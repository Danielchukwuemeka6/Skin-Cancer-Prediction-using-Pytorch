# Skin-Cancer-Prediction-using-Pytorch
Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells and it is most often developed as a result of exposure to the sun.
In this project we utilized pytorch to develop a classifier for predicting "melanoma".

Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. It is developed from the melanin producing cells known as melanocytes.

The model achived an accuracy of 86%.
